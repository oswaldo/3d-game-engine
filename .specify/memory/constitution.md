# 3D Game Engine Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Pure Scala
The engine will be written entirely in Scala, leveraging the full power of the language and its ecosystem. We will avoid wrappers around existing Java libraries unless absolutely necessary, to maintain a pure and idiomatic Scala codebase.

### II. Modularity
The engine must be modular, with a clear separation of concerns between the 2D rendering, 3D rendering, and UI components. This allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of each module.

### III. Immutability by Default
All data structures within the engine shall be immutable by default. Mutable state will be used only when absolutely necessary for performance reasons, and it must be clearly documented and justified. This approach promotes functional programming principles and helps to create a more robust and predictable engine.

### IV. Type-Driven Development
We will leverage Scala's powerful type system to model the domain and prevent bugs at compile time. We will use features like case classes, sealed traits, and type aliases to create a rich and expressive domain model that is both safe and easy to work with.

### V. Lightweight and Minimal Dependencies
The engine will be lightweight and have minimal external dependencies. This will make it easier to set up and use, and it will reduce the risk of dependency conflicts. We will favor small, well-defined libraries over large, monolithic frameworks.

## Development Workflow

All new features must be developed in a separate branch and submitted as a pull request. All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer before being merged. All code must be accompanied by unit tests, and the test coverage must not decrease.

## API Design

The engine's API will be designed to be simple, consistent, and easy to use. It will follow the principles of functional programming and will avoid side effects wherever possible. The API will be well-documented, and we will provide examples of how to use it.

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme governing document of the project. Any changes to the constitution must be proposed as a pull request and approved by a majority of the project's maintainers.
