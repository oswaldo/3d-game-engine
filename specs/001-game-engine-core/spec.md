# Feature Specification: Game Engine Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-game-engine-core`  
**Created**: 2024-05-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create a simple game engine, capable of 2d menus, 2d and 3d environments in pure scala"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a game developer, I want a simple game engine in Scala so that I can create games with 2D menus, 2D environments, and 3D environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new project, **When** I set up the engine, **Then** I should be able to create a simple 2D menu.
2. **Given** a 2D menu, **When** I click a button, **Then** a 2D game environment should load.
3. **Given** a 2D menu, **When** I click another button, **Then** a 3D game environment should load.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the engine fails to initialize?
- How does the engine handle errors during rendering?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The engine MUST provide a way to create 2D menus.
- **FR-002**: The engine MUST provide a way to render 2D environments.
- **FR-003**: The engine MUST provide a way to render 3D environments.
- **FR-004**: The engine MUST be written in pure Scala.
- **FR-005**: The engine MUST be modular.
- **FR-006**: The engine MUST have a clear separation between 2D, 3D and UI components.
- **FR-007**: The engine MUST use immutable data structures by default.
- **FR-008**: The engine's API MUST be simple, consistent, and easy to use.
- **FR-009**: The engine MUST target mid-range performance for 2D and 3D rendering, suitable for indie games.
- **FR-010**: The engine MUST support Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), Mobile (Android, iOS), and Web (via Scala.js) platforms.
- **FR-011**: The engine MUST target modern hardware from the last 2-3 years.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Scene**: A container for all game objects in a given environment (2D or 3D).
- **GameObject**: A basic entity in the game world, which can have components attached to it.
- **Component**: A piece of functionality that can be attached to a GameObject (e.g., a sprite, a mesh, a script).
- **Menu**: A 2D UI element for user interaction.

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-05-22
- Q: What platforms should the engine support (e.g., desktop, mobile, web)? ‚Üí A: All of the above (Desktop, Mobile, Web)
- Q: What level of performance is expected for 2D and 3D rendering? ‚Üí A: Mid-range (e.g., for indie games)
- Q: What should be the target for minimum hardware/software requirements? ‚Üí A: Focus on modern hardware (e.g., last 2-3 years)
